Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
===========================================

Object-oriented programming is all about `indirection`. OOP uses 
indirection for accessing data, just as we did in the previous 
examples by employing variables, files, and arguments. The real 
revolution of OOP is that it uses indirection for calling code. 
Rather than calling a function directly, you end up calling it 
indirectly.

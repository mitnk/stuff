OO Principles
=============

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritence.
- Program to interface, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
- Only talk to your friends.
- Don't call us, we'll call you.
- A class should have only one reason to change.
